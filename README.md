# My Arch dotfiles
These are my very own dotfiles for my current Hyprland setup on Arch, have a look around!

I manage them using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) so they are not direcly transferable, I guess.

## Configurations for
* hyprland
* waybar
* wofi
* dunst
* kitty
* wlogout
* swaylock
* Thunar
